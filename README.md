# Project Overview

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and are increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.

This repository presents an integrated computational transcriptomic workflow for identifying biologically relevant candidate hub lncRNAs associated with LUAD using RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

The project integrates differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis, and external validation to prioritize candidate lncRNAs for future biological and clinical investigation.
